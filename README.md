 Crime Data Analysis Using Python 📊

📌 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on crime data to identify patterns, trends, and key insights. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure of crime data
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Analyze crime patterns and distributions
- Extract meaningful insights using visual analysis

📂 Dataset
- Crime dataset containing information such as crime type, occurrence details, and related features
- The dataset was cleaned and prepared before analysis

🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Feature understanding and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual analysis of crime trends and distributions

❓ Questions Answered
- What are the most common crime types?
- How are crimes distributed across different categories?
- What patterns and trends exist in the crime data?
- Which features provide the most insight into crime occurrences?

 📈 Insights
- Certain crime categories occur more frequently than others
- Clear patterns emerge when analyzing crime data by feature
- Visual exploration helps identify trends that are not obvious from raw data

 ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python and data analysis techniques can be used to explore real-world crime data and generate actionable insights.
